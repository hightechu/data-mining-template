For this Project we are going to be using data from IMDB on movie genres. The set you're using was specifically prepared for this activity and contains movies of only 2 genres - Sci-Fi and Fantasy. The original data set contained 81,000+ movies in multiple languages, and genres, but has been narrowed down to approx. 2,600 movies. More data can help create a more accurate model, but it is at the cost of slower computation. There is a ton of free data sets.
