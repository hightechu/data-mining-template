## Setting up your development environment
You're almost ready to start coding, but first you have to set up your computer so  you can test your program while you code.
### Adding the Project to your Local Machine
You need to add this repository to your computer to make changes and edit it in the development environment. Go ahead and [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository on your computer. Make sure you're in a directory that you'll remember/ is easy to access. If you're not sure, your Desktop is a good go-to.

Open your **terminal**
In command line:
```sh
>cd desktop
>git clone <copied link here>
```
## Installing Requirements
If you don't already, make sure you [install python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Now navigate into your project folder on command line and install the required packages:
```sh
>cd <project-repository-name>
>pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You should be good to move onto the next issue and start coding! If you have any questions, comment on this issue and your mentor will be notified.
