## Process
Students will gain access to this repository through a GitHub classroom.

1. A mentor is assigned to the project
2. Steps of the development process will be assigned in the form of issues
3. Students create a new branch to address an issue
4. Once they have completed a first draft addressing an issue, the student will make a pull request
5. The mentor reviews changes and provides feedback for the student
6. Once the mentor and student are satisfied with the changes, the mentor will merge the pull request, resolving the issue
7. The student moves onto the next issue

## Getting Started
1. To start head to the **issues** tap at the top of this repository
2. On the top right hand side, click new issue
3. Title the issue "Hi, my name is *your name*"
4. Leave a comment saying a little bit about your experience with programming and what you want to learn
5. Click *submit new issue*
6. When the next page loads, scroll to the bottom and click "Pin issue" on the bottom right hand side. This will trigger the creation of the other issues. Give it a few minutes, it could take up to 5 minutes to generate the issues.
7. Complete the issues from the bottom up

Keep in mind that pinning issues will generate all issues again, so try and avoid doing so while working on the project.
